*Most recently, I worked as a Sales Representative at LawSikho from March to December 2025, where I specialized in selling their Independent Director certification program—a high-value product ranging from ₹60,000 to ₹80,000. I consistently managed 100+ outbound calls daily and maintained a 90% conversion rate through a structured three-stage sales process.*

*I'm currently in my final year at JIS College of Engineering, graduating in 2026.

*"I'm drawn to sales because it directly combines relationship-building, problem-solving, and measurable results. During my time at LawSikho, I learned that effective sales isn't just about closing deals—it's about understanding client needs and aligning solutions that add real value to their careers.*

*I enjoy converting objections into opportunities and helping clients make informed decisions. Sales offers continuous learning, and the dynamic nature of the career counseling space appeals to me because every conversation presents unique challenges."*

- Problem-solving mindset
- Results-driven approach
- Continuous growth opportunity

## 3️⃣ What Are Your Short-term and Long-term Goals?

### Your Answer (30-40 seconds)

**Short-term Goals (1-2 years):**
*"In the short term, I want to master the art of consultative selling in the career counseling space. My goal is to consistently exceed my quarterly targets, develop deep expertise in understanding client career transitions, and become a top performer in the sales team. I also want to refine my skills in CRM tools and data-driven sales strategies to improve my conversion rates from 90% to even higher levels."*

**Long-term Goals (3-5 years):**
*"Long-term, I see myself growing into a leadership role—ideally as a Sales Head or Marketing Head. I want to build and mentor high-performing sales teams, develop sales playbooks and strategies that drive organizational growth, and contribute to scaling the business. I'm particularly interested in combining sales leadership with strategic business development to create sustainable growth models."*

## 4️⃣ How Do You Handle Rejection?

### Your Answer (25-35 seconds)

*"I view rejection as a learning opportunity rather than a setback. At LawSikho, I made over 100 dials daily, and naturally, not every call converted. I learned that rejection often isn't personal—it could be timing, budget constraints, or simply not the right fit.*

*My approach was to analyze why the rejection happened: Was it an objection I couldn't overcome? Was the timing wrong? Then I'd refine my pitch accordingly. I maintained detailed notes in the CRM so if a prospect said 'not now,' I could follow up at the right time with better understanding.*

*Most importantly, I didn't let rejection affect my energy for the next call. I maintained a positive mindset and remembered that in sales, every 'no' brings me closer to a 'yes.' My 90% conversion rate from discovery to roadmap calls is proof that persistence and learning from rejection pays off."*

**Key Themes:**

- Resilience and positive mindset
- Learning and improvement focus
- Data-driven approach (CRM tracking)
- Don't take it personally

## 5️⃣ What Is Your Daily Work Routine?

### Your Answer (30-40 seconds)

*"At LawSikho, my day was highly structured and metrics-driven:*

*I would start by reviewing my pipeline in Sell Squad CRM and prioritizing follow-ups. Then I'd conduct 100-150 outbound dials daily to qualified professionals with 15-20 years of experience who were interested in becoming Independent Directors or consultants.*

*Out of these, I typically had 7-8 meaningful conversations lasting 20+ minutes each. These were discovery calls where I'd understand their career goals, challenges, and program readiness.*

*After discovery, I'd schedule roadmap calls to present a personalized plan showing how the certification aligned with their goals. Finally, I'd conduct closure calls to address concerns and complete enrollment.*

*I maintained detailed CRM notes after every interaction and analyzed daily metrics to identify improvement areas. I also dedicated time to learning objection-handling techniques and sales strategies."*

**Key Metrics to Mention:**

- 100-150 dials/day
- 7-8 quality conversations (20+ min)
- Three-stage process: Discovery → Roadmap → Closure
- CRM management
- Continuous improvement
