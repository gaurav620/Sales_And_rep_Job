## CORE QUESTIONS (Guaranteed to be Asked)

## 1️⃣ Tell Me About Yourself (Extended Version)

### Your Answer (60-90 seconds)

*"Good morning/afternoon! Thank you for this opportunity. I'm Gaurav Kumar Mehta, a sales professional with proven experience in high-ticket B2B2C sales within the EdTech and career development sector.*

*Most recently, I worked as a Sales Representative at LawSikho from March to December 2025, where I specialized in selling their Independent Director certification program to experienced professionals with 15-20 years of industry experience. These were individuals seeking to transition into board roles or consultancy positions.*

*The role involved consultative selling—each deal ranged from ₹60,000 to ₹80,000, requiring trust-building and deep understanding of career transitions. My daily process was highly structured: I conducted 100-150 outbound dials using Sell Squad CRM and held 7-8 in-depth conversations of 20+ minutes each. I followed a three-stage sales process—Discovery Call, Roadmap Call, and Closure Call—achieving a 90% conversion rate from discovery to roadmap.*

*Prior to LawSikho, I worked as a Sales Representative Intern at Leads Group from October 2024 to February 2025, handling educational consulting and technology sales. I conducted 80-120 targeted conversations daily with students, parents, and school leaders, maintained an 85% client re-engagement rate, and closed 10+ high-ticket enrollments worth ₹6-8 lakhs.*

*I'm in my final year at JIS College of Engineering, graduating in 2026. During my time there, I served as Marketing Lead for our annual cultural fest, which developed my leadership and stakeholder management skills.*

*What drives me in sales is the combination of relationship-building, problem-solving, and delivering measurable results. I'm particularly interested in career consulting because I value helping professionals make informed decisions about their growth.*

*I've also earned certifications in HubSpot Sales, Salesforce Fundamentals, and Google Analytics to continuously develop my skills.*

*I'm excited about PrimePathway because your mission of helping professionals navigate career transitions aligns with my experience. I see strong potential to contribute to your growth while advancing toward my goal of becoming a Sales Head."*

## 2️⃣ Why Do You Want to Work in Sales?

### Your Answer (45-60 seconds)

*"I'm passionate about sales because it's one of the few careers where your impact is immediately measurable. Three things drive me:*

*First, relationship-building. I excel at connecting with people, understanding their challenges, and building trust. At LawSikho, I worked with senior executives—VPs, Founders, CXOs—who needed more than a sales pitch; they needed a trusted advisor. Building those relationships and seeing them succeed was highly fulfilling.*

*Second, problem-solving. Sales, especially consultative selling, is about diagnosing problems and presenting tailored solutions. Every client has unique career goals, constraints, and concerns. Navigating those conversations, overcoming objections, and finding the right fit is like solving a complex puzzle, and I love that challenge.*

*Third, the meritocracy of sales. In sales, your results speak for themselves. There's no ambiguity—either you hit your targets or you don't. I appreciate that my income, growth, and recognition are directly tied to my performance. It keeps me motivated and accountable.*

*Beyond that, sales offers continuous learning. Every call teaches me something new about industries, people, and persuasion. The dynamic nature—no two days are the same—keeps me engaged and excited.*

*Ultimately, I believe sales is where I can create the most value—both for clients and for the organization. It's the heartbeat of any business, and being part of that growth engine is where I want to be."*

**Key Themes to Convey:**

- Relationship-driven
- Problem-solver mindset
- Results-oriented
- Continuous learner
- Passion for impact

## 3️⃣ Describe Your Sales Process in Detail

### Your Answer (60-90 seconds)

*"I follow a structured, three-stage consultative sales process that I've refined at LawSikho, which has proven highly effective for high-ticket sales:*

**Stage 1: Discovery Call (20-30 minutes)**
*This is where I build rapport and gather intelligence. I start by understanding the prospect's current role, career trajectory, and pain points. Key questions I ask include:*

- *What are your career goals for the next 3-5 years?*
- *What challenges are you facing in your current role or industry?*
- *Have you considered board roles or consultancy positions?*

*I listen actively—my goal is 70% listening, 30% talking. I take detailed notes in Sell Squad CRM, categorizing their needs, urgency, and budget readiness. By the end of this call, I qualify whether they're a good fit and, if yes, I schedule a roadmap call.*

**Stage 2: Roadmap Call (25-40 minutes)**
*This is where I present a personalized solution. Based on the discovery insights, I show them exactly how the Independent Director certification aligns with their goals. I address:*

- *How the program solves their specific challenges*
- *Timeline and commitment required*
- *Expected outcomes and ROI on their career*

*I handle initial objections here—typically around time, relevance, or investment. I use social proof, success stories, and data to build confidence. I achieve a 90% conversion rate at this stage because I've already built trust in the discovery phase.*

**Stage 3: Closure Call (15-30 minutes)**
*This is the final decision-making call. I address any remaining concerns, clarify program details, pricing, and payment plans. I create urgency (limited batch sizes, upcoming deadlines) without being pushy. My approach is consultative—I help them see it as an investment in their career, not an expense.*

*Once closed, I ensure smooth onboarding and maintain follow-ups to build long-term relationships, which often lead to referrals.*

*This process works because it's customer-centric, not product-centric. I'm selling transformation, not just a course."*

**Key Highlights:**

- Three clear stages
- Consultative, not transactional
- Data-driven (CRM usage)
- High conversion rates
- Customer-centric approach

## 4️⃣ How Do You Handle Objections from Customers?

### Your Answer (60-75 seconds)

*"Objection handling is one of my core strengths, and I see objections as opportunities to provide clarity rather than roadblocks.*

*My approach follows four steps:*

**1. Listen Fully**
*I never interrupt. I let the client express their concern completely. Often, objections mask deeper issues, so I listen to understand the root cause.*

**2. Acknowledge and Validate**
*I validate their concern. For example, if they say, 'It's too expensive,' I respond with, 'I completely understand—₹70,000 is a significant investment, and you want to ensure it's worth it.' This builds empathy and trust.*

**3. Reframe the Objection**
*I reframe their concern into a benefit. For pricing objections, I break down ROI: 'This certification could position you for board roles paying ₹5-10 lakhs annually. Compared to that potential, this is a strategic career investment.' I shift the conversation from cost to value.*

**4. Provide Evidence**
*I use social proof—success stories, testimonials, case studies. For example, 'We had a client similar to your profile who was hesitant, but after completing the program, he secured two board positions within six months.'*

**Common Objections I Handle:**

**'I don't have time':**
*'I hear you—you're already managing a demanding role. The program is designed for working professionals like you, with flexible, self-paced modules. Most of our successful students dedicate just 5-7 hours a week. Can we explore a timeline that works for you?'*

**'I'll think about it':**
*'Absolutely, this is an important decision. To help you think through it, can I share what specific concerns you'd like to evaluate? That way, I can provide the right information to make your decision easier.'*

**'I need to discuss with my family':**
*'That makes perfect sense—family support is important. Would it help if I provided a detailed brochure or even set up a brief call with your spouse so they understand the value and career impact?'*

*The key is to stay calm, never get defensive, and always guide the conversation back to their goals and the solution we're offering."*

**Key Techniques:**

- Listen first, respond second
- Empathy and validation
- Reframing objections as opportunities
- Evidence-based responses
- Never pushy, always consultative

## 5️⃣ How Do You Handle Rejection?

### Your Answer (50-65 seconds)

*"Rejection is an inherent part of sales, and I've developed a healthy, productive mindset around it.*

*First, I don't take rejection personally. I remind myself that most rejections aren't about me—they're about timing, budget, priorities, or fit. When someone says no, it often means 'not right now,' not 'never.'*

*Second, I analyze every rejection to learn from it. I ask myself:*

- *Was my discovery thorough enough?*
- *Did I address their core pain points?*
- *Was there an objection I failed to uncover early?*

*I maintain detailed notes in our CRM, tagging reasons for rejection. Over time, patterns emerge—maybe pricing objections spike in certain industries, or timing issues come up with specific seniorities. I use this data to refine my approach.*

*Third, I maintain a strong pipeline. When you're making 100+ dials a day, no single rejection affects your mindset because you know statistically, conversions will come. It's a numbers game, but also a skill game—the better I get, the higher my conversion rate.*

*Fourth, I practice resilience rituals. After a tough rejection, I take a 5-minute break, review a recent win or positive client feedback, and jump back into the next call with fresh energy.*

*Finally, I follow up strategically. Just because someone said no today doesn't mean they won't say yes in three months. I set reminders to check in periodically—sometimes circumstances change, and being top-of-mind leads to future conversions.*

*Rejection has made me more resilient, analytical, and persistent—qualities that have directly contributed to my 90% conversion rate and consistent target achievement."*

**Key Points:**

- Don't take it personally
- Learn from every rejection
- Maintain a strong pipeline
- Resilience practices
- Strategic follow-ups

## 6️⃣ Tell Me About a Time You Closed a Difficult Deal

### Your Answer (Story Format - 90-120 seconds)

**Use the STAR Method: Situation, Task, Action, Result**

*"I'd love to share a specific example from my time at LawSikho that really tested my sales skills.*

**Situation:**
*I was working with a prospect—a VP of Operations at a mid-sized manufacturing company with 18 years of experience. He had expressed interest in our Independent Director certification but was highly skeptical. He had tried two other professional courses in the past that didn't deliver results, so he was hesitant to invest again.*

**Task:**
*My challenge was to rebuild his trust in professional education, differentiate our program from his past experiences, and justify the ₹70,000 investment despite his skepticism.*

**Action:**
*I took a highly personalized approach:*

*First, during the discovery call, I spent extra time understanding his past experiences—what went wrong, what he expected, and what 'success' would look like for him. I learned his real goal wasn't just learning; it was securing board positions within 12 months.*

*Second, I didn't pitch immediately. Instead, I scheduled a follow-up call and did homework—I researched companies in his industry that were actively looking for independent directors. I even identified 3-4 potential board opportunities he could pursue post-certification.*

*Third, during the roadmap call, I presented a career plan, not just a course. I showed him:*

- *How the certification addressed his exact goals*
- *Success stories from similar profiles (VPs transitioning to board roles)*
- *The specific board opportunities I'd researched for him*

*I also offered to connect him with an alumni who had a similar background and successfully transitioned into board roles. That conversation was a game-changer—it built third-party credibility.*

*Fourth, I addressed his pricing concern by breaking down ROI: 'If you secure even one board role paying ₹6-8 lakhs annually, this ₹70,000 investment pays for itself in less than two months—and board roles often last years.'*

*Finally, I stayed patient. He took three weeks to decide, and I followed up respectfully with additional resources, not pressure.*

**Result:**
*He enrolled in the program. Three months later, he reached out to thank me, sharing that he'd secured his first independent director position at a logistics company. He even referred two colleagues to me, resulting in two additional closures worth ₹1.4 lakhs in revenue.*

*This deal taught me that difficult sales are won with patience, personalization, and genuine value creation—not aggressive tactics."*

**Why This Story Works:**

- Specific and detailed
- Shows problem-solving
- Demonstrates consultative approach
- Quantifiable results
- Shows long-term relationship building

## ADDITIONAL DEEP-DIVE QUESTIONS

## 7️⃣ What Are Your Strengths and Weaknesses?

### Strengths (Pick 2-3)

*"My core strengths are:*

**1. Consultative Selling:**
*I excel at understanding client needs deeply and presenting tailored solutions. My 90% conversion rate from discovery to roadmap is a testament to this.*

**2. Resilience and Persistence:**
*Making 100+ dials daily requires mental toughness. I stay motivated even through rejection and maintain consistent performance.*

**3. Data-Driven Approach:**
*I leverage CRM analytics to identify patterns, optimize my pitch, and prioritize high-intent leads, which improves efficiency."*

### Weakness (Pick 1 - and show how you're working on it)

*"One area I'm actively working on is delegation. Since I'm used to managing my entire pipeline independently, I sometimes take on too much rather than collaborating with team members for support. I'm improving by scheduling regular check-ins with colleagues to share leads and best practices, which has helped me balance workload better and learn from others."*

---

## 8️⃣ How Do You Prioritize Your Leads?

### Your Answer (40-50 seconds)

*"I use a combination of CRM data and qualification criteria to prioritize leads:*

**1. BANT Framework:**

- *Budget: Can they afford ₹60-80k?*
- *Authority: Are they the decision-maker?*
- *Need: Do they have a genuine career goal aligned with our solution?*
- *Timeline: Are they looking to act soon?*

**2. Engagement Level:**
*Leads who've attended webinars, downloaded resources, or engaged with follow-up emails get higher priority because they've shown intent.*

**3. Pipeline Stage:**
*I focus on leads closest to closure first—roadmap and closure stage—while keeping discovery calls moving forward.*

**4. High-Value Potential:**
*Senior professionals (15+ years experience) often have stronger networks, leading to referrals, so they get prioritized.*

*I review my pipeline daily and adjust priorities based on urgency and potential."*

---

## 9️⃣ What Motivates You in Sales?

### Your Answer (35-45 seconds)

*"Three things motivate me:*

**1. Achieving Targets:**

**2. Client Success:**
*Knowing that my guidance helped someone transition into a board role or advance their career is incredibly fulfilling. It's not just about commission—it's about impact.*

**3. Continuous Growth:**
*Sales constantly challenges me to improve—whether it's handling a new objection, refining my pitch, or learning about different industries. That growth mindset keeps me motivated daily."*

## 🗣️ Common Scenario-Based Questions

**Q: If a client says, 'I don't think this is the right time for me,' how would you respond?**  
*A: "I completely understand—timing is crucial for major career decisions. Can I ask, what specifically makes you feel it's not the right time? Is it a bandwidth issue, budget, or something else? [Listen] Based on what you've shared, many of our most successful clients initially felt the same way, but they found that waiting often means missing opportunities. What if we explored a flexible timeline that works better for you? We could even start with [specific smaller commitment] to ease into it. Would that be worth considering?"*

**Q: How do you manage a situation where a lead goes cold?**  
*A: "I'd first review my CRM notes to understand where the conversation stalled. Then I'd reach out with a value-driven touchpoint—maybe sharing a relevant success story, an industry insight, or a new opportunity that aligns with their goals. I avoid generic 'just checking in' messages. If they still don't respond, I set a reminder to follow up in 4-6 weeks with fresh information. Persistence with value, not pressure, is key."*

**Q: What would you do if you missed your monthly target?**  
*A: "First, I'd analyze why—was it pipeline issues, conversion rate, or external factors? Then I'd create a recovery plan: increase daily dials, revisit stalled leads, seek coaching from top performers, and double down on high-intent prospects. I'd also communicate transparently with my manager about my action plan and progress. Missing a target is a learning opportunity, not a failure, and I'd ensure it doesn't happen again by refining my approach."*
