## CORE QUESTIONS (Guaranteed to be Asked)

## 1️⃣ Tell Me About Yourself (Extended Version)

### Your Answer (60-90 seconds)

*"Good morning/afternoon! Thank you for this opportunity. I'm Gaurav Kumar Mehta, a sales professional with proven experience in high-ticket B2B2C sales within the EdTech and career development sector.*

*Most recently, I worked as a Sales Representative at LawSikho from March to December 2025, where I specialized in selling their Independent Director certification program—a ₹60,000 course targeting experienced professionals (15-20 years experience) seeking board roles or consultancy positions.*

*My daily process was highly structured: I made 100-120 outbound dials using Sell Squad CRM and held 7-8 in-depth conversations of 20+ minutes each. I followed a three-stage sales process—Discovery Call, Roadmap Call, and Closure Call—achieving a 90% conversion rate from discovery to roadmap. I was a top 10 performer in a team of 70-80 people.*

*Prior to LawSikho, I worked as a Sales Representative Intern at Leads Group from October 2024 to February 2025, conducting 80-120 targeted conversations daily with students, parents, and school leaders, achieving an 85% client re-engagement rate.*

*I'm in my final year at JIS College of Engineering, graduating in 2026. I also served as Marketing Lead for our annual cultural fest, developing leadership and stakeholder management skills.*

*What drives me in sales is the combination of relationship-building, problem-solving, and delivering measurable results. I'm particularly interested in career consulting because I value helping professionals make informed decisions.*

*I've earned certifications in HubSpot Sales, Salesforce Fundamentals, and Google Analytics to continuously develop my skills.*

*I'm excited about PrimePathway because your mission aligns with my experience. I see strong potential to contribute to your growth while advancing toward my goal of becoming a Sales Head."*

## 2️⃣ Why Do You Want to Work in Sales?

### Your Answer (40-50 seconds)

**Three key reasons:**

1. **Relationship-building** — I excel at connecting with senior executives (VPs, CXOs) who need a trusted advisor, not just a sales pitch
2. **Measurable results** — Sales offers clear metrics; my performance directly reflects my efforts, which keeps me motivated and accountable
3. **Continuous learning** — Every call teaches me about industries, people, and persuasion; no two days are the same
4. **Problem-solving** — I love diagnosing client challenges and presenting tailored solutions that genuinely add value

---

## 3️⃣ Describe Your Sales Process in Detail

### Your Answer (60 seconds)

**I follow a three-stage consultative sales process:**

**Stage 1: Discovery Call (20-30 minutes)**

- **First step** — Build rapport and understand their current role, career trajectory, and pain points
- **Second step** — Ask key qualifying questions (career goals, challenges, interest in board roles)
- **Third step** — Listen 70%, talk 30%; take detailed CRM notes on needs, urgency, budget
- **Fourth step** — Qualify fit and schedule roadmap call if aligned

**Stage 2: Roadmap Call (25-40 minutes)**

- **First step** — Present personalized solution showing how the ₹60,000 certification aligns with their goals
- **Second step** — Address specific challenges, timeline, commitment, and ROI
- **Third step** — Handle objections (time, cost, relevance) using social proof and success stories
- **Result:** 90% conversion rate at this stage

**Stage 3: Closure Call (15-30 minutes)**

- **First step** — Address final concerns, clarify program details and pricing
- **Second step** — Create urgency (limited batch sizes) without being pushy
- **Third step** — Frame it as career investment, not expense
- **Fourth step** — Ensure smooth onboarding and follow-ups for referrals

*This works because it's customer-centric—I'm selling transformation, not just a course.*

## 4️⃣ How Do You Handle Objections from Customers?

### Your Answer (50-60 seconds)

**My four-step objection handling framework:**

**Step 1: Listen Fully** — Never interrupt; let them express concerns completely to understand root cause

**Step 2: Acknowledge and Validate** — Build empathy (e.g., "I understand—₹60,000 is a significant investment")

**Step 3: Reframe the Objection** — Shift from cost to value (e.g., "One board role pays ₹5-10 lakhs annually; this investment pays for itself in 2 months")

**Step 4: Provide Evidence** — Use success stories, testimonials, and case studies to build confidence

**Common objections I handle:**

- **"No time"** — Explain flexible, self-paced modules (5-7 hours/week)
- **"I'll think about it"** — Ask what specific concerns they want to evaluate
- **"Need family approval"** — Offer to provide brochure or call with spouse

*Key: Stay calm, never defensive, always guide back to their goals.*

---

## 5️⃣ How Do You Handle Rejection?

### Your Answer (40-50 seconds)

**Four key approaches:**

1. **Don't take it personally** — Most rejections are about timing, budget, or fit, not about me
2. **Analyze and learn** — Review each rejection to identify patterns and refine approach
3. **Document in CRM** — Tag reasons for rejection to spot trends and improve over time
4. **Maintain strong pipeline** — With 100-120 dials daily, no single rejection affects my mindset
5. **Practice resilience** — Take short breaks after tough rejections, review recent wins, then re-engage
6. **Follow up strategically** — Set reminders for 3-6 months; circumstances change

*My 90% conversion rate proves this approach works.*

## 6️⃣ Tell Me About a Time You Closed a Difficult Deal

### Your Answer (STAR Method - 90 seconds)

**Situation:**
I was working with a VP of Operations (18 years experience) interested in our Independent Director certification but highly skeptical. He'd tried two other courses that didn't deliver results.

**Task:**
Rebuild his trust, differentiate our program, and justify the ₹60,000 investment despite skepticism.

**Action - Step-by-step approach:**

**First step** — Spent extra time on discovery to understand his past failures and define what 'success' meant (securing board positions in 12 months)

**Second step** — Did homework between calls—researched 3-4 potential board opportunities in his industry

**Third step** — Presented a career plan (not just a course) showing how certification + those opportunities align

**Fourth step** — Connected him with alumni with similar background who successfully transitioned to board roles (third-party credibility)

**Fifth step** — Broke down ROI: "One board role pays ₹6-8 lakhs annually; this ₹60k investment pays for itself in 2 months"

**Sixth step** — Stayed patient through his 3-week decision period with resources, not pressure

**Result:**
He enrolled. Three months later, secured his first independent director position at a logistics company. Referred two colleagues, resulting in ₹1.4 lakhs additional revenue.

*Lesson: Difficult sales require patience, personalization, and genuine value—not aggressive tactics.*
